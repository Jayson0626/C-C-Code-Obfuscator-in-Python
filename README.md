# C-C-Code-Obfuscator-in-Python
The Minor Project was a C/C++ Source Code Obfuscator and Deobfuscator in Python in which various Code Obfuscation techniques like variable renaming, Digraphs &amp; Trigraphs, Dead Code Injection, String Encryption, Code Pattern Printing etc were implemented and a Deobfuscator was built for the same techniques. At last, the Obfuscator was measured using various metrics like Cyclomatic Complexity, Clone Code Detection, N-Gram, Memory Used and Execution Time. The Obfuscation Techniques showed considerable results.


How to run the project:
Copy-Paste the desired C/C++ Code in the variable str in the Python Code.
